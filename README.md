# The-Gibeau-Gazette
What could be better than being at the happiest place on earth? How about keeping up on the news there?! Track all the latest Disney news with The Gibeau Gazette. 



## How to Use
When the user downloads The Gibeau Gazette, they click the Scrape button to capture the most up to date Disney news articles (sourced from wdwmagic.com). Articles will then populate on the page, showing a small image, the article title, a quick article summary, and a link to the full article. The user can then create notes by clicking the Notes button. Notes will continue to append, with the ability for users to delete notes.

## Feedback
It was fun to see the potential of scraping. I can see how this would be beneficial for fun things (such as populating news for a blog) as well as for business purposes (such as price matching). The hardest part of this project was not getting distracted by the fun articles! Surprisingly, adding the ability to append notes and then to delete them proved to be time consuming, but was a good exercise.  It was also nice to work more with Handlebars and to see how that technology lends efficiency to programming.
